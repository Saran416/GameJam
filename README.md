**Concept and Idea behind the Game**
You Have been cursed with the INFAMOUS MILO CURSE.
Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong
So you must venture out into the ancient land of Gravitas, to find the alien artifact that controls
gravity and fate itself
Find this item to finally change your fate and normalize your luck.
**Themes used and how?**
Milo Murphy:
(lvl1)
If you touch mountains, you will stumble on your rock and roll to your death
Sometimes even wall jumps fail
(lvl2)
Among the many batches of matchsticks you brought for this trip only 15 of these matchsticks
work
Sometimes your head gets flung too fast
(lvl3)
In the Alien land beyond the cave even gravity works against you and you must skillfully
understand the space time distortions to power through
Occam's Razor:
There are very easy simple straightforward paths in level 1 and level 2 that easily get you to the
final level
