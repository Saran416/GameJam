**Concept and Idea behind the Game**<br>
You Have been cursed with the INFAMOUS MILO CURSE.<br>
Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong<br>
So you must venture out into the ancient land of Gravitas, to find the alien artifact that controls<br>
gravity and fate itself<br>
Find this item to finally change your fate and normalize your luck.<br>
**Themes used and how?**<br>
Milo Murphy:<br>
(lvl1)<br>
If you touch mountains, you will stumble on your rock and roll to your death<br>
Sometimes even wall jumps fail<br>
(lvl2)<br>
Among the many batches of matchsticks you brought for this trip only 15 of these matchsticks<br>
work<br>
Sometimes your head gets flung too fast<br>
(lvl3)<br>
In the Alien land beyond the cave even gravity works against you and you must skillfully<br>
understand the space time distortions to power through<br>
Occam's Razor:<br>
There are very easy simple straightforward paths in level 1 and level 2 that easily get you to the
final level<br>
